    "The product strategy review describes a neuro-symbolic assistant designed for daily planning\nand health monitoring. The memo states that customers struggle with chaotic schedules, so the\nteam proposes a multi-stage architecture that first compresses calendar streams and wearable\ndata into a structured canvas. This canvas contains timelines of predicted commitments,\nentities such as teammates, medications, and devices, and direct quotes from recent\ncommunications. The expert reasoning module then performs scenario planning, highlighting\nrisks like missed handoffs, medication conflicts, or duplicate meetings. Key milestones:\n- Q3 pilot with ten enterprise teams that already adopted the context compression plugin.\n- Q4 expansion that integrates with hospital record systems and adds clinician review loops.\nThe risks listed include data quality gaps, regulatory questions for medical guidance, and\nlatency when downloading raw transcripts. The memo emphasizes that a lightweight controller\nshould adapt reasoning depth to difficulty so latency and token usage remain low."
